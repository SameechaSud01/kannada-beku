# Beginners' Guide to Kannada

A one-screen reference primer covering the Kannada vowel inventory (Varnamaale), retroflex-vs-dental and geminated consonant rules, a consonant chart, and the pronunciation key. Shown once during onboarding as a forced step, persisted server-side as a Lesson 0 row, re-enterable later from the Learn tab.

## Goal

Give a learner a 60-second mental model of "how Kannada sounds map to English" *before* they meet a real phrase in Lesson 1. Today, Lesson 1 (Greetings) drops the learner straight into transliterated phrases like `chennāgiddēne` without context for what `ē`, `ā`, the retroflex vs dental distinction, or the long-vowel macron actually mean. This spec fixes that gap.

This is a **reference surface, not a curriculum lesson**: no drills, no scoring, no streak contribution, no progress percentage. It is consumed once and remains available as a glossary.

## Source artifact

`kannada reference/Kannada Beginners Guide — Vowels & Consonants.pdf` (3 pages — vowels, consonant grid + rules, pronunciation key). Editor uploads the PDF to the same folder as `Kannada Reference — Lessons 1–6.pdf`; this spec is the contract, the PDF is the raw material. Treated like every other reference artifact: `verified: false` until a native speaker audits the rows.

## Decision summary

| Question | Answer | Lock |
|---|---|---|
| Where does it appear in the app flow? | New onboarding step `/onboarding/basics`, inserted between `/onboarding/commitment` and `/(tabs)`. | `[LOCKED]` |
| Forced or skippable? | Forced once during onboarding (no skip). Re-entry is voluntary. Onboarding completes only when the user taps "Continue" at the end of the screen. | `[LOCKED]` |
| Where does the content live? | Lesson 0 row in `public.lessons` (`lesson_no = 0`, `slug = 'basics'`). `content_json` carries a new optional `reference.sections` array. | `[LOCKED]` |
| Does it count toward progress / streak / completion? | No. Lesson 0 is excluded from `completedLessons`, XP, streak, and `user_overall_progress`. The lesson list on `/(tabs)/learn` continues to render slots 1–8 only. | `[LOCKED]` |
| Where does the user re-enter the guide later? | A persistent "Kannada basics" entry card pinned above the lesson list on `/(tabs)/learn`, plus a one-time dismissible toast on first home arrival after onboarding pointing to it. | `[LOCKED]` |
| Text hierarchy on this surface? | **Exception** to [spec_text_hierarchy.md](spec_text_hierarchy.md): on the guide's vowel and consonant cards, **Kannada script is primary** (large, Noto Serif Kannada), transliteration second, English example third. Rationale below. | `[LOCKED]` |

## Foundation-doc amendments required (land in same PR)

This spec cannot ship until these `[LOCKED]` rows are amended:

1. **[NAVIGATION.md](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md)** — J1 step list goes from 5 → 6 steps; route table adds `/onboarding/basics`.
2. **[CONTENT.md](../../docs/foundation/CONTENT.md)** — adds a "Lesson 0 — Basics (reference primer)" section under Curriculum overview, called out as outside the 8-slot scenario curriculum.
3. **[STATE.md](../../docs/foundation/STATE.md)** — `useUserStore` gains `hasSeenBasicsGuide` and `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` flags.
4. **[spec_lesson_content_source.md](spec_lesson_content_source.md)** — adds `sections?: GuideSection[]` as an optional sibling of `words[]` / `phrases[]` inside `content_json.reference`, with a note that it is used only by Lesson 0 today.

A new entry in [CONTRADICTIONS.md](../../docs/foundation/CONTRADICTIONS.md) (C11) tracks the gap between the spec landing and the code shipping.

## Scope

In:
- New onboarding screen `/onboarding/basics`, slotted as step 6 of 6 (`ProgressDots total={6}`, `current = 5`).
- New `/guide` route, identical content, no `ProgressDots`, used for voluntary re-entry from the Learn tab.
- New `<BasicsCard />` pinned above the lesson list on `/(tabs)/learn` (above lesson 1).
- New seed migration adding the Lesson 0 row with `content_json.reference.sections`.
- New `useUserStore.hasSeenBasicsGuide` and `useUserStore.hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` flags, persisted via the existing `user_prefs` AsyncStorage key.
- One-time dismissible toast on home after first onboarding completion.

Out:
- TTS / audio for individual glyphs. The guide is read-only in v1. (Follow-up spec can wire device TTS for the vowel and consonant items.)
- A drill, quiz, or completion test on the guide.
- Heritage-style long-form articles on Kannada history or script evolution.
- A "guide" tab in the bottom nav.
- Deep links from individual lesson runners to specific guide sections (`/guide#vowels`). Defer to a follow-up.
- A reusable `<VocabStack />` extracted across the app. Other surfaces stay transliteration-first per [spec_text_hierarchy.md](spec_text_hierarchy.md); this is a one-surface exception.

## Content shape

`[LOCKED]` — section IDs and titles. Item content sourced from the PDF and seeded by migration.

Four sections, ordered:

| Order | Slug | Title | Subtitle | Item type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `vowels` | Vowels (ಸ್ವರಗಳು) | "Kannada has 13 vowels. Long vowels use a macron — `ā`, `ē`, `ī`, `ō`, `ū`." | `GlyphItem` |
| 2 | `consonant-rules` | Sounding consonants | "Three patterns to watch for: retroflex, dental, and doubled letters." | `RuleItem` |
| 3 | `consonants` | Consonant chart (ವ್ಯಂಜನಗಳು) | "The 34 consonants grouped by where they're produced in the mouth." | `GlyphItem` |
| 4 | `pronunciation-key` | Reading transliteration | "Symbols you'll see across the app." | `KeyItem` |

### Section 1 — Vowels (`vowels`)

13 `GlyphItem`s in PDF order:

| # | kannada | transliteration | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ಅ | a | "as in *America*" |
| 2 | ಆ | ā | "as in *art*" |
| 3 | ಇ | i | "as in *igloo*" |
| 4 | ಈ | ī | "as in *seed*" |
| 5 | ಉ | u | "as in *push*" |
| 6 | ಊ | ū | "as in *moon*" |
| 7 | ಋ | ṛ | "as in *rupees*" |
| 8 | ಎ | e | "as in *cake*" |
| 9 | ಏ | ē | "as in *crane*" |
| 10 | ಐ | ai | "as in *ice*" |
| 11 | ಒ | o | "as in *opener*" |
| 12 | ಓ | ō | "as in *go*" |
| 13 | ಔ | au | "as in *owl*" |

### Section 2 — Sounding consonants (`consonant-rules`)

3 `RuleItem`s. Each has a `kind`, a one-line `rule`, and 2–4 `example` rows with `{transliteration, english}` pairs (no Kannada glyph — the rule is about how the romanisation maps to a sound).

| kind | rule | examples |
|---|---|---|
| `retroflex` | "Capital letters mean retroflex — tongue curls up and back, touching the ridge behind the teeth. Hollow, fuller sound." | `Ta` → "Top", `Da` → "Dark", `Na` → "Pranam", `La` → "haLLi" |
| `dental` | "Lowercase letters mean dental — tongue tip touches the back of the upper front teeth. Flat, soft, far forward." | `ta` → "Bharath", `da` → "the", `na` → "narrator", `la` → "large" |
| `geminated` | "Doubled letters are held slightly longer than a single one." | `appa` → "father", `amma` → "mother" |

### Section 3 — Consonant chart (`consonants`)

34 `GlyphItem`s in PDF grid order. Split into two visual groups in the migration but rendered as one ordered list. See [§Migration](#migration) for the full row list.

### Section 4 — Reading transliteration (`pronunciation-key`)

8 `KeyItem`s — each is a `{symbol, example}` pair, no Kannada glyph.

| symbol | example |
|---|---|
| `Ta` | "Top" |
| `ta` | "Bharath" |
| `Da` | "Dark" |
| `da` | "the" |
| `Na` | "Pranam" |
| `na` | "narrator" |
| `La` | "haLLi" |
| `la` | "large" |

## Data model

### `content_json.reference.sections` schema

`[LOCKED]` — extends [spec_lesson_content_source.md](spec_lesson_content_source.md). Optional field, used by Lesson 0 today; other lessons leave it absent.

```ts
type GuideSection = {
  slug: 'vowels' | 'consonant-rules' | 'consonants' | 'pronunciation-key';
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  order: number;                 // 1-indexed
  items: GuideItem[];
};

type GuideItem = GlyphItem | RuleItem | KeyItem;

type GlyphItem = {
  kind: 'glyph';
  kannada: string;
  transliteration: string;
  example: string;               // "as in America" — already includes 'as in' prefix
};

type RuleItem = {
  kind: 'rule';
  ruleKind: 'retroflex' | 'dental' | 'geminated';
  title: string;                 // e.g. 'Retroflex (capital letters)'
  description: string;           // the one-line rule
  examples: Array<{ transliteration: string; english: string }>;
};

type KeyItem = {
  kind: 'key';
  symbol: string;
  example: string;
};
```

### Lesson 0 row

`[LOCKED]`

```jsonc
{
  "lesson_no": 0,
  "title": "Kannada basics",
  "slug": "basics",
  "situation": null,                      // not a scenario lesson
  "real_world_prompt": null,
  "audio_url": null,
  "content_json": {
    "reference": {
      "source": "kannada-beginners-guide.pdf",
      "verified": false,
      "words": [],
      "phrases": [],
      "sections": [ /* see §Migration */ ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Why `words` / `phrases` are empty arrays, not omitted:** keeps [spec_lesson_content_source.md](spec_lesson_content_source.md) rule 3 ("Empty references are represented as `{}`, not as a `reference` with empty arrays") *not violated* — because this reference is not empty: it carries `sections`. The empty `words[]` and `phrases[]` exist for shape consistency so a future audit script can still iterate them without a key-existence check.

> **Tradeoff acknowledged:** rule 3 was written before `sections` existed. Strict reading says "either reference is `{}` or it has words/phrases." We're picking a third path: reference can also carry `sections` instead. The spec_lesson_content_source.md amendment makes this explicit.

### TypeScript canonical layer

`[LOCKED]` — mirrors the lesson 1–8 pattern. The guide content has both a runtime canonical TS file *and* a DB snapshot:

| Artifact | Source of truth for | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `constants/guide.ts` | The rendered guide | App runtime — the `/onboarding/basics` and `/guide` screens import directly |
| `public.lessons` row, `slug = 'basics'`, `content_json.reference` | The reference vocab from the PDF | Nobody at runtime today — humans only |

Same as lessons: the two are not synced. The TS file is the curriculum decision (what to render, in what order, with what subtitles); the DB row is the raw material. Drift is allowed by design.

## Navigation

### J1 (first-time sign-up) — amended flow

`[LOCKED]` — amends [NAVIGATION.md J1](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md#j1-first-time-sign-up).

1. App launch → `AppGate` → no session → `/(auth)/login`
2. User signs up → not onboarded → `/onboarding/welcome`
3. Welcome → Name → Goal → Motivation → Commitment → **Basics** → `setOnboarding()` → `/(tabs)`

`ProgressDots total={6}` across screens 2–6; `current` runs 0..5.

`setOnboarding()` now sets both `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` and `hasSeenBasicsGuide: true` (Continue on Basics is the trigger). `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` stays `false` so the home toast fires once.

### Route table — amended row

`[LOCKED]` — amends [NAVIGATION.md route table](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md#route-table).

| Path | File | Group layout | Header | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/onboarding/basics` | `app/onboarding/basics.tsx` | Stack, `slide_from_right`, `headerShown: false` | none | Beginners' Guide (step 5/5, Step 6 of 6) |
| `/guide` | `app/guide.tsx` | root stack, screen-owned back chip | Screen-owned back chip + title | Voluntary re-entry from Learn tab. Identical content; no `ProgressDots`. |

### Back behavior

`[LOCKED]` — amends [NAVIGATION.md back-behavior table](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md#back-behavior).

| Flow | Back affordance | Behavior on tap |
|---|---|---|
| `/onboarding/basics` | inline Back/Continue pair (matches other onboarding screens) | `router.back()` to `/onboarding/commitment`. No confirm — selections are already committed. |
| `/guide` | screen-owned back chip | Plain `router.back()`. |

## Screen — `/onboarding/basics` and `/guide`

`[LOCKED]` — same component, two route entry points.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Layout | Vertical `ScrollView` with `contentContainerStyle.paddingBottom` for the sticky CTA. |
| Header (onboarding only) | "Step 5 of 5" eyebrow (per ProgressDots total=6, but the spoken "Step N of 5" label excludes welcome — matching the existing eyebrow rule from [spec_onboarding_tweaks.md](spec_onboarding_tweaks.md)). |
| Title | "Before you start" |
| Subtitle | "A quick guide to how Kannada sounds. You can revisit this anytime from the Learn tab." |
| Sections | Rendered in `order`, each as `<GuideSection />` (subtitle row, then items in a list). |
| Item rendering | `<GlyphCard />` for `glyph`, `<RuleCard />` for `rule`, `<KeyRow />` for `key`. See [§Components](#components). |
| Sticky CTA (onboarding only) | "Continue" — full-width red CTA matching the locked onboarding button pattern. Always enabled. Tap → `setOnboarding({ ..., hasSeenBasicsGuide: true })` → router replaces to `/(tabs)`. |
| Sticky CTA (`/guide` re-entry) | Hidden. Back chip handles exit. |
| Back chip (`/guide` only) | 40×40 `ExitBackButton` per [NAVIGATION.md back-behavior](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md#back-behavior). |

### Components

`[LOCKED]` — all live under `components/guide/` (one component per file). All consume tokens from [constants/colors.ts](../../constants/colors.ts), [constants/spacing.ts](../../constants/spacing.ts), [constants/fonts.ts](../../constants/fonts.ts).

| Component | Renders | Hierarchy |
|---|---|---|
| `<GuideSection title subtitle children />` | Section header + items list. No card chrome around the section itself (No-Line rule per [DESIGN.md](../../docs/foundation/DESIGN.md)). | n/a |
| `<GlyphCard kannada transliteration example />` | A row: **Kannada glyph (primary, large)** / transliteration (secondary, medium italic) / example (tertiary, small). | **Kannada-first exception.** See §Text-hierarchy exception below. |
| `<RuleCard title description examples />` | Rule heading, description paragraph, then a small table of `transliteration → english` example rows. No Kannada glyphs (the rule is about romanisation). | n/a — rule is prose, not a vocab item. |
| `<KeyRow symbol example />` | A single-line row: monospace `symbol` left, en-dash, `example` right. | n/a — symbol is romanisation, not Kannada script. |

### Text-hierarchy exception

`[LOCKED]` — narrowly scoped.

[spec_text_hierarchy.md](spec_text_hierarchy.md) locks **transliteration as primary** for every Kannada vocabulary surface. The Beginners' Guide intentionally inverts this for `<GlyphCard />` only:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│           ಆ                          │  ← Kannada, ~64pt, Noto Serif Kannada, Colors.onSurface
│                                     │
│             ā                        │  ← transliteration, ~24pt, Lora italic, Colors.onSurfaceVariant
│        as in art                    │  ← example, ~14pt, DM Sans, Colors.tertiary
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this is consistent with the rule's intent, not a violation:**

The locked rule exists because the *learner cannot read Kannada script yet* — putting it first makes the script the cognitive load and slows recall. That's true for *vocabulary surfaces*, where the learner is trying to remember a word's meaning or pronunciation from the script alone.

The Beginners' Guide is a different surface: the user is *learning to recognise* the script itself. The Kannada glyph IS the subject of the row, not a reference label next to a more important romanisation. Inverting the hierarchy here is the only honest rendering — putting transliteration first would tell the learner "memorise the romanised name `ā`, and here's a small reference glyph next to it," which is the opposite of what this screen is for.

**Scope of the exception:** the `<GlyphCard />` component only. `<RuleCard />` and `<KeyRow />` don't render Kannada script at all, so the rule does not apply. Every other surface in the app remains under the locked transliteration-first hierarchy.

This exception is documented at the rule itself: [spec_text_hierarchy.md §4 Out of scope](spec_text_hierarchy.md#4-out-of-scope-intentionally-unchanged) gets a new bullet pointing here.

### Re-entry — Learn tab card

`[LOCKED]`

A `<BasicsCard />` pinned above the lesson list on [app/(tabs)/learn.tsx](../../app/%28tabs%29/learn.tsx), above lesson 1's pill. Visual:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📖   Kannada basics                              │
│       Vowels, consonants, how to read it          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Card uses `Colors.surfaceContainerLow`, no border (No-Line rule), `Radius.lg`.
- Icon: `Icons.book` (new map entry, `IconBook2` from Tabler).
- Title font `Fonts.dmSans.semibold`, size `moderateScale(16)`, `Colors.onSurface`.
- Subtitle font `Fonts.dmSans.regular`, size `moderateScale(13)`, `Colors.tertiary`.
- Tap target full-row, min height `moderateScale(64)`.
- Tap → `router.push('/guide')`.

### Re-entry — first home toast

`[LOCKED]`

On first arrival at `/(tabs)/` after onboarding completion (`hasSeenBasicsGuide === true && hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge === false`), fire a one-time toast via `ToastHost`:

> Tap "Kannada basics" on the Learn tab anytime to revisit the primer.

On dismiss (or auto-dismiss after 5s), set `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge = true`. Never fires again, even across reinstalls (the flag is persisted in `user_prefs`).

## State changes — `useUserStore`

`[LOCKED]` — adds two fields and updates `setOnboarding`. AsyncStorage key `user_prefs` unchanged; both fields default `false` for users with persisted state from before this change.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hasSeenBasicsGuide` | `boolean` | True once the user reaches the end of `/onboarding/basics` and taps Continue, **or** sets it true if they open `/guide` voluntarily later. Default `false`. |
| `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` | `boolean` | True after the one-time home toast dismisses. Default `false`. Install-scoped (kept by `resetForUser`). |

Actions:
- `setHasSeenBasicsGuide(seen: boolean)` — new.
- `setHasSeenBasicsHomeNudge(seen: boolean)` — new.
- `setOnboarding(data)` extended: also writes `hasSeenBasicsGuide: true`.

`resetForUser(userId)`: keep `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` (install-scoped, like `hasSeenTtsWarning`); clear `hasSeenBasicsGuide` (per-user — a new sign-up on the same install should see the guide).

## Migration

`[LOCKED]` — file path and idempotency pattern.

New migration: `services/api/migrations/2026-06-XX_lesson_0_basics_seed.sql`.

Pattern mirrors [2026-05-20_lessons_content.sql](../../services/api/migrations/2026-05-20_lessons_content.sql) — idempotent UPSERT keyed by slug. Two statements:

```sql
-- 1. Insert the row if it doesn't exist; do nothing if it does (slug is unique).
insert into public.lessons (lesson_no, title, slug, situation, real_world_prompt, content_json, audio_url)
values (0, 'Kannada basics', 'basics', null, null, '{}'::jsonb, null)
on conflict (slug) do nothing;

-- 2. Overwrite content_json idempotently — the spec leads, the migration follows.
update public.lessons
set content_json = $json$

Re-running the migration is safe: `insert ... on conflict do nothing` skips when the row exists; the `update ... where slug = 'basics'` overwrites in place. The pattern is identical to the existing lesson 1–6 migration.

> **Why not bundle into the existing `2026-05-20_lessons_content.sql`:** that file is dated and named for lessons 1–6. Editing it after the fact would muddy the commit-history-as-version-log convention from [spec_lesson_content_source.md](spec_lesson_content_source.md). A new file is more honest.

## Exclusion from progress / completion

`[LOCKED]` — none of these touch Lesson 0.

| Surface | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `useProgressStore.completedLessons` | Never receives `'basics'` (the guide screen does not call `useCompleteLessonMutation`). |
| `useProgressStore.xp` / `streak` / `totalPhrasesLearned` | Unchanged by the guide. |
| `user_lesson_progress` table | No row inserted for `lesson_id` of the basics row. The `record_lesson_completion` RPC is never called with the basics lesson id. |
| `user_overall_progress` (% complete) | The `recompute_overall_progress` trigger function counts lessons via `where lesson_no between 1 and 8`. Adding `lesson_no = 0` outside that range is invisible to the formula. **Verify** the existing query before merging — if it's `where lesson_no > 0` or `where slug != 'basics'`, no change needed. If it's an unbounded `count(*)`, the trigger function needs a `where lesson_no > 0` filter added. |
| `/(tabs)/learn` lesson list | Renders slots 1–8 only (`PLANNED_LESSON_SLOTS` already excludes 0). The basics card is rendered separately above the list. |

> **TODO during implementation:** read [services/api/migrations/2026-05-27_db_wiring_games_and_overall.sql](../../services/api/migrations/2026-05-27_db_wiring_games_and_overall.sql) and confirm the lesson-count predicate in `recompute_overall_progress`. If it counts all `lessons` rows, add a `where lesson_no > 0` filter in the same PR as this spec.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] [docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md](../../docs/foundation/NAVIGATION.md) J1 step list and route table reflect the 6-step flow and the `/onboarding/basics` + `/guide` routes.
- [ ] [docs/foundation/CONTENT.md](../../docs/foundation/CONTENT.md) curriculum overview acknowledges Lesson 0 as a reference primer outside the 8-slot scenario curriculum.
- [ ] [docs/foundation/STATE.md](../../docs/foundation/STATE.md) `useUserStore` table lists `hasSeenBasicsGuide` and `hasSeenBasicsHomeNudge` with the right reset semantics.
- [ ] [spec_lesson_content_source.md](spec_lesson_content_source.md) acknowledges the optional `sections?: GuideSection[]` field inside `content_json.reference`.
- [ ] [docs/foundation/CONTRADICTIONS.md](../../docs/foundation/CONTRADICTIONS.md) has an active entry (C11) tracking the spec-vs-code gap until shipped.
- [ ] Migration `2026-06-XX_lesson_0_basics_seed.sql` inserts the row and populates `content_json` per the schema above. Verify by `select content_json -> 'reference' -> 'sections' from public.lessons where slug = 'basics'`.
- [ ] `recompute_overall_progress` predicate verified to exclude `lesson_no = 0` (or amended in this PR).
- [ ] First-time sign-up flow visits `/onboarding/basics` between commitment and home; verified end-to-end on iPhone SE (375×667) and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
- [ ] Tap-through Continue on basics → home → toast fires once → revisit Learn tab → "Kannada basics" card visible → tap → `/guide` opens.
- [ ] Second app launch: no toast, no forced revisit; basics card still on Learn tab.
- [ ] All new components use tokens from `Colors`, `Spacing`, `Fonts`, `Radius` — no hex literals, no raw pixels.
- [ ] Type-check passes; existing tests pass; no new test required for the static guide screen but the new `useUserStore` setters get unit tests if any consumer reads them.

## Decisions

`[LOCKED]`

1. Placement is a forced onboarding step (not a modal, not a lesson, not an optional card).
2. DB shape is a Lesson 0 row with `content_json.reference.sections` — reuses the existing table.
3. Text hierarchy on `<GlyphCard />` inverts to Kannada-first. Documented exception, not a general rule change.
4. Lesson 0 is excluded from progress, streak, XP, and the overall % computation.
5. Re-entry surfaces are the persistent Learn-tab card and the one-time home toast — no global "?" button, no profile-screen entry.
6. No audio in v1. Reading-only.
7. The TS file at `constants/guide.ts` is canonical for the rendered screen; the DB row is a reference snapshot. Same drift-allowed contract as the lessons.

## Open

`[OPEN]`

- **Audio (v2):** wire device TTS on each `<GlyphCard />` tap to speak the Kannada character. Would also need a play button on `<RuleCard />` examples. Defer until lesson-level audio polish lands.
- **Per-lesson deep links into the guide:** e.g. a "What does the macron mean?" info icon next to a long vowel in Lesson 1 that opens `/guide#vowels`. Out of v1 — re-entry via the Learn tab is sufficient.
- **Long-vowel macron callout copy:** the subtitle on the vowels section says "Long vowels use a macron — ā, ē, ī, ō, ū." Confirm with a native speaker that this captures the distinction usefully for an English-speaking learner. `verified: false` until audited.
- **Verification of the consonant grid:** several rows on page 2 of the PDF have minor ambiguities — `ddha` for ಢ (is it `Dha` or `Ddha`?), `Nha` for ಣ (vs `Na`), `sshha` for ಷ (vs `ṣha`). Held against `verified: false`; native-speaker audit closes them in a follow-up commit, not a re-spec.
- **Should Lesson 0 visually surface anywhere in the profile screen?** Possibly under "Resources." Out of v1.
